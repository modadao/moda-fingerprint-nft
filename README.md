# Moda Finger Printing NFT

## Description
MODADAO have developed a novel way to persist the fingerprint of tracks on the blockchain.  The fingerprint is a unique identifier of a track, which is generated by the fingerprinting algorithm.  The fingerprint is stored in the blockchain and can be used to identify the track.  The fingerprint is also used to verify the authenticity of the track.

## Contracts
The smart contract stores the values in a key value pair, with x being the dependent variable and a collection of y values as the independent vairable.

Eg:  Given the following pair of values:

```text
    x = [1, 2, 2, 2, 5]
    y = [1, 131, 17, 95, 2]
```

| Key (x) | Value (collection of y) |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | [1] |
| 2 | [131, 17, 95] |
| 5 | [2] |

Therefore:

```text
1 => 1
2 => 131, 17, 95
5 => 2
```

The smart contract will store the following values:

```json
{
    "shape": [
        255,
        4418
    ],
    "coords": {
        "x": [
            0,
            1,
            28,
            29,
```


## API

A NodeJS / Typescript / Express API has been developed to interact with the smart contract.  It
